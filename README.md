# Observing Covid-19 Cases

This project is used to observe the **overall scene** of the Covid-19 pandemic, involving the quantities of reported positive-negative cases in most parts of the globe.
Please note that the data is *minorly biased*, hence a confusion may happen during observation.

For more details of the project (including reasons why this project was born, the aim of the project, etc.), please read at the `covid19.Rmd` file.
